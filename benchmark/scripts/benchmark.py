# This file contains a python implementation of the benchmark code
# used in dart to test the biodart project's modules.
# It is not very idiomatic to python as I am trying to keep the structure
# similar to the dart's one. However, I tried to not impede performance
# in doing so.
# ! This must be ran after the dart's code since this does not contain utility
# functions to download the file (s).
